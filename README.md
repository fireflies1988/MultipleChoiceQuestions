# Multiple-choice questions
This is a console application with UI that allows you to take tests with timer, review your test, CRUD test questions, students and subjects (data is saved in files).

This is my first project about coding and C++ is the first language I have learned.

This project is the final exam of data structures and algorithms course instructed by Luu Nguyen Ky Thu. 
There are 4 or 5 (I don't remember clearly) different topics and the instructor randomly assigned each topic to each group of students. Each group has 1-3 students. My group has two members: me and my roommate Bui Van Tuan.
Our topic is about making a multiple-choice questions application. The instructor required us to use data structures and algorithms in our project such as "Single linked list", "Binary tree search",... 
At that time I had no experience in programming. It took our group more than a month to complete this project.
